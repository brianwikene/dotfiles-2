# List of steps to restore my Macbook to working conditions

## Notes to myself

* Symlink what you can to dotfiles directory

# Recipe
Run those scripts in this order!
```
./restore-mac.sh
sudo ./sudo-restore-mac.sh
```

## TODO:

* How to restore:
  - iTerm2 settings
  - Karabiner
  - BetterTouchTools
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - VS Code settings (should be backed up automatically!)
