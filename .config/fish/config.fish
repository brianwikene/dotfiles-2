# Store history from all tabs
history merge
# History from various tabs is stored in separate sessions, so by default it's not possible to run a command in 1 tab and immediately have access to it in another tab (https://mvolkmann.github.io/fish-article/#CommandHistory).
# To synchronize history from other tabs, you need to run `history merge`
# To run the `history merge` command each time you press arrow up to perform history search (that way we don't have to merge after each single command, as discussed here: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/825) - you need to put the following line in the ./functions/fish_user_key_binding.fish - but it doesn't seem to work :/
#bind -k up 'history --merge ; up-or-search'
